# Space Shooter Game

Welcome to the Space Shooter Game, a classic implementation of the timeless space shooter experience in Python. This project is a result of my journey learning pygame, guided by the invaluable tutorials provided by the YouTube Channel: freeCodeCamp. Along the way, I've incorporated some personal tweaks to enhance the gameplay.
